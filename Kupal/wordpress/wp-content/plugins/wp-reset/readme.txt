WP Reset resets the entire site or selected parts using advanced reset options to default values. 100% safe to use with built-in restore function.

== Description ==

<a href="https://wpreset.com/">WP Reset</a> quickly resets the site's database to the default installation values without modifying any files. It deletes all customizations and content, or just chosen parts like theme settings. WP Reset is fast and safe to use thanks to the built-in snapshots which provide 1-click restore functionality. It has multiple fail-safe mechanisms so you can never accidentally lose data. WP Reset is extremely helpful for plugin and theme developers. It **speeds up testing & debugging** by providing a quick way to reset settings and re-test code. It's the only WP development tool for non-developers.

For support please use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-reset">official forum</a>, and if you need more information visit <a href="https://wpreset.com/">wpreset.com</a> and be sure to check out the <a href="https://wpreset.com/">roadmap</a> for the list of upcoming features.

Access WP Reset admin page via the "Tools" menu.

**Please read carefully before proceeding to understand what WP Reset does, and remember to always create a snapshot**

#### Resetting will delete:

* all posts, pages, custom post types, comments, media entries, users
* all default WP database tables
* all custom database tables that have the same prefix table prefix as the one defined in _wp-config.php_ and used by default tables

#### Resetting will not delete or modify:

* media files - they remain in the _wp-uploads_ folder untouched but will no longer be listed under Media in admin
* no files are touched; plugins, themes, uploads - everything stays
* site title, WordPress address, site address, site language and search engine visibility settings
* currently logged in user will be restored with the current username and password

#### What happens when I click the Reset button?

* remember to always create a snapshot first or a full backup
* you will have to confirm the action one more time because there is NO UNDO
* everything will be reset; see bullets above for details
* site title, WordPress address, site address, site language, search engine visibility settings as well as the current user will be restored
* you will be logged out, automatically logged in and taken to the admin dashboard
* WP Reset plugin will be reactivated if that option is chosen in the post-reset options

#### Undoing a reset

Before doing a reset, create a snapshot. The button is located right next to the reset button and it takes less than 10 seconds to create a snapshot. After reset is done, if you need to undo it simply restore the snapshot and that's it.

#### WP-CLI support

WP Reset comes with full WP-CLI support. Help on our WP-CLI commands is available via _wp help reset_. By default the commands have to be confirmed but you can use the `--yes` option to skip confirmation. Instead of the active user, the first user with admin privileges found in the database will be restored after reset. Please be careful when using WP Reset with WP-CLI - as with using the GUI always make a snapshot or backup first.

Currently supported WP-CLI commands:

* `wp reset reset`
* `wp reset version`
* `wp reset delete`
* `wp reset snapshots`


#### Database Snapshots

Database snapshot is a copy of all WP database tables, standard and custom ones, saved in the currently used database (as set by _wp-config.php_). Files are not saved or included in snapshots in any way.
Snapshots are primarily a development tool. Although they can be used for backups (and downloaded as gzipped SQL dumps), we suggest finding a more suitable tool for doing backups of live sites. Use snapshots to find out what changes a plugin made to your database - what custom tables were created, modified, deleted or what changes were made to site's settings. Or use it to quickly restore the development environment after testing database related changes.
Restoring a snapshot does not affect other snapshots, or WP Reset settings. Snapshots can be compared to current database tables, restored (by overwriting current tables), exported ad gzipped SQL dumps, or deleted. Creating a snapshot on an average WordPress installation takes 1-2 seconds.

#### Multisite (WP-MU) Support

WP Reset has yet to be completely tested with multisite! Please be careful when using it with multisite enabled. We don't recommend to resetting the main site. Sub-sites should be OK. We're working on making WP Reset fully compatible with WP-MU. Till then please be careful. Thank you for understanding.

#### Partial Reset Tools

* Delete transients - deletes all transient related database entries. Including expired and non-expired transients, and orphaned timeout entries.
* Delete uploads - delete all files and folder in the /uploads/ folder.
* Delete plugins - deletes all plugins except WP Reset which remains active.
* Reset theme options - resets all options for all themes that use the WP theme mods API.
* Delete themes - deletes all themes.
* Empty or delete custom tables - empties (truncates) or deletes (drops) all custom database tables.
* Delete .htaccess file - deletes the .htaccess file. If you need to edit .htaccess without FTP use our free <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-htaccess-editor/">WP Htaccess Editor</a> plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does WP Reset make backups? =

Automatically no, it does not. But we have "download backup" links besides every tool in the plugin so make sure you download a backup before running them. Backups only contain the database, no files!

= How can I log in after resetting? =

Use the same username and password you used while doing the reset. Only one user will be restored after resetting. The one you used at that time.

= Will any files be deleted or modified when I reset the site? =

No. All files are left untouched if you do a full reset. However, there are tool like "delete themes" that do delete files.

= Will I have to reconfigure wp-config.php? =

Absolutely not. No reconfiguration is needed. No files are modified.

= Do you support WP-CLI? =

We sure do! Just type "wp reset" in your shell to see the list of available commands and options.

= How long does it take for the reset operation to complete? =

On most installations a second or two. If you have a huge amounts of data in tables then up to ten seconds.
